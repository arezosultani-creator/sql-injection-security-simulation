# SQL Injection Security Simulation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how SQL injection vulnerabilities occur and how they
can be mitigated using secure coding practices in a MySQL-based system.

The goal of this project is to improve authentication security, protect data,
and strengthen audit readiness.

## Key Features
- Simulated SQL injection attacks
- Identified high-risk input fields
- Implemented secure query handling
- Reduced unauthorized access risks

## Skills & Concepts
- SQL Injection
- Secure Coding
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Risk Analysis
- Authentication & Access Control

## Code Explanation
This project includes a Python script that compares vulnerable SQL queries with
secure, parameterized queries to prevent injection attacks.
